"""CopywriterAgent — page-content generation for the per-section AI
button + the wizard's per-page builder path.

Stays on Sonnet 4.x. Cost rationale:
  - This is the agent that writes the actual website copy operators
    ship. Switching to a smaller model risks the kind of bland /
    generic output that erases the value of the whole pipeline; user
    feedback already established that quality matters most here.
  - cache_system=True: the static section-type guide + items shape
    examples (~1.5KB of stable text) live in the system prompt so
    Anthropic's ephemeral cache covers them. The per-section AI button
    fires multiple times per builder session, so cache hits compound:
    first call writes (1.25× input cost), every subsequent call reads
    (0.1× input cost) within the 5-minute window.

The output schema (PageContentDecision wrapping list[PageSection]) is
typed so the schema-retry policy catches Sonnet's rare "wraps the
list in a {sections: ...} envelope" or "drops a required sectionType
field" misses — the previous extract_json path silently dropped those.

NOTE: the bulk /content-map endpoint (Phase A + Phase B + parallel
batches) is a separate refactor — its prompt is bigger, the parallel
batching is delicate, and Phase A (Gemini Flash) doesn't need the
same migration. We leave content-map on the existing call_llm path
and migrate page-content alone here. Phase 2-5b can pick up the bulk
path once this proves out.
